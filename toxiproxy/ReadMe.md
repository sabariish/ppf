Java-client example for ToxiProxy with a Windows server.

To Run tests:
- Run src\test\resources\testrun.xml as a TestNG suite
or
- mvn integration-test

There are 6 tests.

Preconditions:
Make sure to have couple of applications running on ports 5000 and 3000. I used a sample react node app to play around.
